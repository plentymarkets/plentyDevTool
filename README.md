# plentyDevTool

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Check out the `main` branch.
3. Open the command line.
4. Run `npm i` to install the node modules.
5. Run `npm start` to start the application.

For configuration details and the functionality of the app, refer to the docs.

## Code structure

plentyDevTool uses Angular as its UI framework. The related components are located in the `src/app` folder. These components follow the basic structure of an Angular project. The most important ones are the following:
* `app.module.ts` - contains all the imported components
* `app-routing.module.ts` - contains the routes
* `components` directory - contains the different views
* `providers` directory - contains the services, interfaces and enums

The `src/sync-worker` directory contains all functions responsible for file synchronisation.

The main file `main.ts` contains the functions for creating, starting and updating the application.

## Code functionality

The application uses [https://www.electronjs.org/](ElectronJS) to transform a web application into a desktop application. Using the `ipcRenderer` module from Electron, you can send asynchronous or synchronous messages to the main process or to a specified window. This includes the three functions `send`, `sendSync` and `sendTo`. You can learn more about them in the Electron documentation: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-renderer.

The `providers` directory contains the `ElectronService`. This service defines the two functions used for sending messages:
* `sendToMain(channel, payload?)`
* `sendToSyncWorker(channel, payload?)`

Most of the messages sent from Angular trigger the second method.

### Example 1: User actions

If a user does not have modified files, they're not able to execute a **Push** action, so the button is disabled. However, the user can perform the same action by using a shortcut. The shortcuts are defined in the `main.ts` file which can be accessed by sending a message through `ipcRenderer.sendToMain()`.

```
this.electronService.sendToMain(
    state ? EVENTS.menu.enable : EVENTS.menu.disable,
    MENU_ITEMS.actions.push
 );
```

After the message is received, a function is called in `main.ts`. `IpcMain` is imported from Electron and the method `.on()` is used to subscribe to the response.

`ipcMain.on(EVENTS.menu.enable, (event, menuItemId) => toggleMenuItem(menuItemId, true));`

`ipcMain.on(EVENTS.menu.disable, (event, menuItemId) => toggleMenuItem(menuItemId, false));`

### Example 2: Synchronisation

To initialise and synchronise the selected plugins, a message is sent through `ipcRenderer.sendTo()`, but first calling the function from `ElectronService`.

```
this.electronService.sendToSyncWorker(EVENTS.syncer.init, options);

-> this.ipcRenderer.sendTo(this.syncWorkerWebContentsId, channel, payload);
```

In the `syncer.ts` file, the method `ipcRenderer.on()` is called and used to subscribe to the response.
```
ipcRenderer.on(EVENTS.syncer.init, 
      (event, options: SyncerOptionsInterface) => {
          log.debug('initEvents');
          â€¦
          this.init(options);
      }
);
```

Two very important files are `syncer.ts` and `watcher.ts`. The messages are emitted using `ElectronService` and subscribed to in the syncer. In the constructor, we subscribe to the following events:
1. Initialisation - initialises the selected plugins
2. Pulling - pulls the selected plugins
3. Pushing - pushes the changes
4. Installing - installs the chosen plugins
5. Stopping - stops the synchronisation

The watcher will start after the initialisation is done or before the first job from the queue. The connection to the watcher is made by calling the following functions:
* `start()` - initialises the watcher and the subscriptions to:
    * `onWatcherAdd()`
        * checks if the `localPath` should be synchronised, checks if there are any new or modified files and pushes them into an array
    * `onWatcherChange()`
        * checks if the `localPath` should be synchronised, check if there are any modified files and pushes them into an array
    * `onWatcherUnlink()`
        * checks if the `localPath` should be synchronised, checks if there are any deleted files and pushes them into an array
    * `onWatcherReady()`
        * checks if there are any differences between the current files and all the entries from the database and pushes them into an array
        * emits a message which contains the changes
        * emits a message which contains new plugins which can be installed (only if the option **Detect new plugins** is selected)
* `stop()` - closes the watcher
* `getChanges()` - gets the changes

## Logging

### Write Logs

* Main process:
  
    import * as log from 'electron-log';
  
    log.info('Hello World', value1, value2, ...);

* Angular App:
  
    LogService.info('Hello World', value1, value2, ...);

### Loglevel

1. error
2. warn
3. info (information you want to see every time, for example: JobQueue is empty)
4. debug (information you **DON'T** want to see every time, for example: Writing a key to the localstorage)

### Read Logs

Logs will be displayed in the terminal and in the DevTools (DevTools do not include some entries from the start of the application).

Logs will also be written to the following files:

* **on Linux:** `~/.config/<app name>/log.log`
* **on macOS:** `~/Library/Logs/<app name>/log.log`
* **on Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\<app name>\log.log`

## You want to use a specific lib (like rxjs) in electron main thread?

You can do this! Just by importing your library in npm dependencies (not devDependencies) with `npm install --save`. It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to the final package. Then use your library by importing it in `main.ts` file.
